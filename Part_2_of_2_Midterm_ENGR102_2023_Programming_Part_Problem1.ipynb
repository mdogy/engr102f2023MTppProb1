    "Computers aren't really able to generate truly random numbers. Instead, they use an algoirthm to generate a sequence of numbers that appear to be random. One such algorithm is called the \"linear congruential generator\". It depends on four parameters: a multiplier we call \"a\", a modulus we call \"m\", and an increment we call \"c\" and a starting value \"x0\" also called the seed or start. x0 is the first number in the sequence. The next number in the sequence is given by the formula:\n",

    "\n",
